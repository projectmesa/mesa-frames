mesa-frames API
===============

Overview
--------

mesa-frames provides a DataFrame-first API for agent-based models. Instead of representing each agent as a distinct Python object, agents are stored in AgentSets (backed by DataFrames) and manipulated via vectorised operations. This leads to much lower memory overhead and faster bulk updates while keeping an object-oriented feel for model structure and lifecycle management.


Mini usage flow
---------------

1. Create a Model and register AgentSets on ``model.sets``.
2. Populate AgentSets with agents (rows) and attributes (columns) via adding a DataFrame to the AgentSet.
3. Implement AgentSet methods that operate on DataFrames
4. Use ``model.sets.do("step")`` from the model loop to advance the simulation; datacollectors and reporters can sample model- and agent-level columns at each step.
