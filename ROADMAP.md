# Roadmap

This document outlines the near-term roadmap for mesa-frames as of October 2025.

### 1) LazyFrames for Polars + GPU

Switch Polars usage from eager to `LazyFrame` to enable better query optimization and GPU acceleration.

Related issues:

- [#52: Use of LazyFrames for Polars implementation](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-frames/issues/52)

- [#144: Switch to LazyFrame for Polars implementation (PR)](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-frames/pull/144)

- [#89: Investigate Ibis or Narwhals for backend flexibility](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-frames/issues/89)

- [#122: Deprecate DataFrameMixin (remove during LazyFrames refactor)](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-frames/issues/122)

Progress and next steps:

- Land [#144](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-frames/pull/144) and convert remaining eager paths to lazy.

- Validate GPU execution paths and benchmark improvements.

- Revisit Ibis/Narwhals after LazyFrame stabilization.

- Fold DataFrameMixin removal into the LazyFrames transition ([#122](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-frames/issues/122)).

### 2) AgentSet Enhancements

Expose movement methods from `AgentContainer` and provide optimized utilities for "move to optimal" workflows.

Related issues:

- [#108: Adding abstraction of optimal agent movement](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-frames/issues/108)

- [#118: Adds move_to_optimal in DiscreteSpaceDF (PR)](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-frames/pull/118)

- [#82: Add movement methods to AgentContainer](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-frames/issues/82)

Next steps:

- Consolidate movement APIs under `AgentContainer`.

- Keep conflict resolution simple, vectorized, and well-documented.

### 3) Research & Publication

JOSS paper preparation and submission.
