abstract="Mesa is an agent-based modeling framework written in Python. Originally started in 2013, it was created to be the go-to tool in for researchers wishing to build agent-based models with Python. Within this paper we present Mesa's design goals, along with its underlying architecture. This includes its core components: 1) the model (Model, Agent, Schedule, and Space), 2) analysis (Data Collector and Batch Runner) and the visualization (Visualization Server and Visualization Browser Page). We then discuss how agent-based models can be created in Mesa. This is followed by a discussion of applications and extensions by other researchers to demonstrate how Mesa design is decoupled and extensible and thus creating the opportunity for a larger decentralized ecosystem of packages that people can share and reuse for their own needs. Finally, the paper concludes with a summary and discussion of future development areas for Mesa.",

ABSTRACT = {Agent-based models (ABMs) are one of the most effective and successful methods for analyzing real-world complex systems by investigating how modeling interactions on the individual level (i.e., micro-level) leads to the understanding of emergent phenomena on the system level (i.e., macro-level). ABMs represent an interdisciplinary approach to examining complex systems, and the heterogeneous background of ABM users demands comprehensive, easy-to-use, and efficient environments to develop ABM simulations. Currently, many tools, frameworks, and libraries exist, each with its characteristics and objectives. This article aims to guide newcomers in the jungle of ABM tools toward choosing the right tool for their skills and needs. This work proposes a thorough overview of open-source general-purpose ABM tools and offers a comparison from a two-fold perspective. We first describe an off-the-shelf evaluation by considering each ABM tool’s features, ease of use, and efficiency according to its authors. Then, we provide a hands-on evaluation of some ABM tools by judging the effort required in developing and running four ABM models and the obtained performance.},
